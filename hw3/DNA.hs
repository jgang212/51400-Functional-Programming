{- 
    Define Show and Eq instances for Base, BasePair, Strand, and Helix. 

    The show for a "Base" value should be the strings: "A" or "T" or "C" or "G"
    The show for a "BasePair" value should be formatted using tuple syntax with the base letter. For example: "(A,T)" or "(G,C)"
    The show for a "Strand" value should be formatted using list syntax with the base letters. For example: "[A,B,C,T]"
    The show for a "Helix" value should be formatted using tuple syntax and list syntax with the base letters. For example: "[(A,B),(C,T)]"

    Hint: Remember you can use the "++" to combine strings together

{-
    wccHelix :: Strand -> Helix. 
    Given a Strand, generate a Helix.

    Requirements 
    -------------
    1. The function can only use HOFs. You cannot use Prelude list functions. You can redefine Prelude (Data.List) functions but they must be redefined using HOFs.  
    2. You can define helper functions but they can only use HOFs if they return lists.  
    3. Although we did not cover it in class, you are allowed to use list comprehension but it's not required. 

    Hint: This function can be written in one line.

    Example: 
    Main*> wccHelix (Strand [A,T,C,G]) 
    [(A,T),(T,A),(C,G),(G,C)] 
-} 

wccHelix :: Strand -> Helix
wccHelix (Strand bases) = Strand [map show bases]

{- 
    makeHelix :: String -> Helix. 
    Given a String of base letters, make a Helix.

    Requirements 
    -------------
    1. The function can only use HOFs. You cannot use Prelude list functions. You can redefine Prelude (Data.List) functions but they must be redefined using HOFs.  
    2. You can define helper functions but they can only use HOFs if they return lists.  
    3. You can reuse functions defined in this file. 
    4. Although we did not cover it in class, you are allowed to use list comprehension but it's not required. 

    Hint: This function can be written in one line.


    Example: 
    Main*> makeHelix â€œACTG" 
    [(A,T),(C,G),(T,A),(G,C)]

{- 
   willAnneal :: Strand -> Strand -> Bool. 
   Determine whether two strands will perfectly anneal (i.e., every base is a Watson-Crick complementarity).
   
    Requirements

    1. The function can only use HOFs. You cannot use Prelude list functions. You can redefine Prelude (Data.List) functions but they must be redefined using HOFs.  
    2. You can define helper functions but they can only use HOFs, if they return lists.
